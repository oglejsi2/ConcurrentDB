     * 2.   Sleep time in the CallableTask_Lesson2.     
     * Both will show us, how the tasks are executed. Both tasks are started at the same time. One with the larger number after OK or ERR, finishes after the other. 
     * Although we made shutdown of Executer, it waits for both tash to end and then continues.

        0.  Change CallableTask_Lesson2. Call method 
        1.  Initialize executor
        2.  CallableTask_Lesson2.submit -> ExecutorService executes "call" procedure in Callable class        
        3.  Let's make another CallableTask CallableTask_Lesson2 with initial parameter err
        4.  ExecutorService.shutdown(); sends signal to shutdown executor. Executor won't stop. It will continue to execute until last task finishes.
        5.  Thread.sleep(1000);                                                       // If one runs this code from within database, the database will burn the procesor -> let it sleep for a while.
        
        
        ExecutorSrvice runs the call method but we don't see any result. We can get result by implementing toString method in CallableTask_Lesson2.java
